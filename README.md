---- Sales Frequency Analysis Tool ----

The Sales Frequency Analysis Tool is a C++ program that analyzes sales data to provide insights into sales performance. The program can search for specific products to see how many were sold, list all products and how many were sold, and display a histogram of all sold items.

---- Problem Statement ----

The Sales Frequency Analysis Tool aims to solve the problem of analyzing sales data to identify patterns and trends in sales performance. By providing a user-friendly interface to search and display sales data, the program helps businesses make informed decisions about their sales strategies.

---- Project Summary ----

The Sales Frequency Analysis Tool is a C++ program that uses the "Search" class to parse a file of sales data, back up the file, and perform various search and display functions. The program displays a menu of options for the user to select, and then executes the selected function. The program is designed to be user-friendly, with input validation and error handling to ensure that the user enters valid input.

---- Key Features ----

  -Search for specific products to see how many were sold
  -List all products and how many were sold
  -Display a histogram of all sold items

---- Areas of Strength ----

The code for the Sales Frequency Analysis Tool is well-organized and easy to read. The program makes effective use of the "Search" class to parse and analyze sales data, and the menu-based interface is user-friendly.

---- Areas for Improvement ----

There are several areas where the code could be improved. First, the program could benefit from additional error handling to ensure that the user does not enter invalid input. Second, the program could be optimized to handle large datasets more efficiently. Third, the program could be made more secure by implementing data encryption or other security measures.

---- Challenging Pieces of Code ----

The most challenging part of the project was designing the "Search" class to parse and analyze sales data. This required a deep understanding of data structures and algorithms, as well as the ability to work with large datasets. To overcome this challenge, I consulted online resources and worked closely with my peers to identify the most efficient and effective approaches.

---- Transferable Skills ----

The Sales Frequency Analysis Tool project has helped me develop several transferable skills, including:

  -Data analysis and visualization
  -Object-oriented programming
  -User interface design
  -Error handling and debugging
  -Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability
  -To make the program maintainable, readable, and adaptable, 
  
I followed best practices for code organization and documentation. I used clear and concise variable names and function names, and I commented my code thoroughly to explain the purpose and functionality of each section. Additionally, I designed the program to be modular, so that individual functions can be updated or replaced as needed without affecting the overall functionality of the program.
